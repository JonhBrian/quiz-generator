# Welcome to my very first program with Python

# Quiz Genetator
This program can generate how many quizzes you want about US state capitals (it can be adapted to any country).
Students aren't suppose to cheat but they can do it sometimes.
That's why this program randomize the order of questions so that each quiz is unique, making it impossible for anyone
to crib answers from anyone else.
Of course, doing this by hand would be a lengthy and boring affair. Fortunately, this Python script is available.

Here is what the program does:
* Creates different quizzes (how many quizzes you want);
* Creates multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order;
* Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each;
question, also in random order;
* Provides the answers in a separate folder;
* All answers files are numbered just as the quizzes files (they match each other).
